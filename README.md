# B2W_Colorization
important files to make black & white images colorful 

packages required: 
opencv_contrib_python, 
numpy, 
matplotlib (optional)

to run the code you need 3 files among which model folder contain 2 files and 
the 3rd one you need to download from the link given the model folder in txt file.

place the 3rd file in the model folder itself 

those who want to run in colab try refer .ipnyb file
and other can refer .py file.

Make sure you have packages properly installed, still facing issues can connect with me.
Hope this would have helped you,
